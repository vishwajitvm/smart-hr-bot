⚡ So the AI will auto-fill:

    Department / Team
    Work Mode
    Employment Type
    Experience Level
    Salary Range (suggested)
    Job Description
    Responsibilities
    Requirements
    Benefits / Perks

And the manual fields remain:

    Hiring Manager
    Location
    No. of Openings
    Application Deadline
    Status
    Visibility
    Application Method
