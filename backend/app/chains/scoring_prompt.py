scoring_prompt_template = """
You are an advanced HR AI assistant trained in candidate evaluation, ATS scoring, and job fit analysis. 
Your task is to analyze the candidate data and job description and generate a JSON response with subjective scoring only. 
Deterministic scores (skills, experience, keyword_density) are provided separately by the caller — DO NOT recompute them.

=====================================================
CANDIDATE DATA
- Skills: {skills}
- Years of Experience: {experience}
- Resume Text: {resume_text}

JOB DESCRIPTION
{job_description}

Precomputed by system (DO NOT modify):
- skills_score: {precomputed_skills_score}
- experience_score: {precomputed_experience_score}
- keyword_density: {precomputed_keyword_density}
=====================================================

### RULES (STRICT)

- **All numeric fields**: Integers only, between 0–100. No decimals.

- **projects**: 90–100 if highly relevant, 30–60 if somewhat related, 0 if irrelevant.
- **ats**: 100 if resume is ATS-friendly (clear formatting, sections, bullet points), 50–70 if partially, 0 if poor.
- **grammar**: 80–100 if strong; 50–70 if weak; else 0.
- **soft_skills**: Score quality and relevance of extracted soft skills.
- **readability**: 60–100 if resume is well-structured and easy to follow; <60 if hard to read.

  "soft_skills": 70,
  "readability": 80,
  "cultural_fit": 75,
  "domain_relevance": 85,
  "certifications_score": 50,
  "sentiment": {{
      "overall": "Positive",
      "tone": "Professional",
      "soft_skills_extraction": ["Teamwork", "Adaptability", "Leadership"]
  }},
  "strengths": {{

  }},
  "weaknesses": {{
      "technical": ["AWS", "Docker"],
      "soft": ["Adaptability"]
  }},
  "recommendation": "The candidate shows strong technical ability in JavaScript and React and demonstrates good communication. However, they lack experience in AWS and Docker, which are critical. Their education is relevant, and the resume is well-formatted. Cultural fit is promising, but adaptability appears limited. Overall, the candidate is strong but may require cloud-related upskilling.",

}}
